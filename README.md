A repository for workshop knowledge and materials as part of the Past Biodiversity Change RCN

## About

The geoscience community bridges a variety of research areas which use a wide variety of paleoclimatic, geochemical, paleobiological, and archaeological records. This research coordination network supports groups of investigators to communicate, innovate, coordinate, and standardize research practices, training, and educational activities across disciplinary, organizational, geographic and international boundaries.

Community curated data resources (CCDRs) in the paleoecological, contemporary ecological, paleoclimatic, and archeological disciplines will be improved through three aims: 1) Improving interoperability and reproducibility by developing guidance for interoperability among long-tail CCDRs and promoting adoption of common metadata standards and FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) data principles, 2) Fostering data curation and stewardship by promoting best practices in data science, curation, and stewardship, particularly for early-career researchers, 3) Supporting equity and improving democratization and access to science by promoting the learning and implementation of CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles in disciplinary data resources. Communities of practice will be developed to further these aims through annual in-person symposia and project activities including workshops, working group meetings, and webinars.
